          <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
          <p>My interest in IT started from a young age, being exposed to gaming consoles and personal computers being achievable for average income households. I don’t have any memory of a life without technology, whether it be from TV, to stereo, to the good old dial-up internet and facsimile machine.</p>
          <p>My first experience that truly got me interested in the world of IT was when Playstation’s and Xbox’s alike could get chipped to run games downloaded off the internet and burned to disc – I was in love! Although I was too young at this age to truly grasp what I was doing, downloading many viruses thanks to LimeWire, I did enjoy editing my MySpace into the coolest profile on the internet, giving me my first real experience with some form of programming.</p>
          <p>As time went on my addiction to gaming fuelled my desire to learn more about the world of IT, from the use of wall hacks and aim bots, scripts to simulate real player input on RuneScape, AddOns to make my life in the World of Warcraft a whole lot easier. It was at this point I had decided to start a degree in computer systems engineering, however, being a young gaming and computer addict, I dropped out. I have since completed 2 trades as an Electrician and as a Cable Jointer, both keeping me closely tied to the world of IT, mostly through automation and tv/data installations.</p>
          <p>I now feel I am at a point in my life where I am ready to study and finish what I started many moons ago.</p>
          <p> I chose to study at RMIT as I did my studies for my trade here and had a positive experience, couple that with the fact RMIT offer up a 100% online course made it an easy decision. I am hoping for my studies at RMIT to lead me into a career path in IT, who knows where it will start or end the only thing I know for sure is that I am interested!</p>

          <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
          <h2><em>Senior Full Stack Developer</em></h2>
          <p><a href="Resources\JobAd.pdf">See Job Ad Here</a></p>
          <p>Description: A full stack developer is a web developer who is proficient in both front end and back end web development. Front end development refers to user-facing software, built and managed using programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Back end development refers to the server-side of the website or application, built and managed using programming languages like Java, PHP, Ruby and Python.</p>
          <p>To be successful in this position I would require:</p>
          <ul class="main-list">
            <li>Significant experience using C# (5+ years)</li>
            <li>Experience with SQL database, Entity Framework and other .Net ORMS</li>
            <li>Experience using TypeScript, React, Redux/GraphQL with server/api driven application workflow</li>
            <li>Experience in Azure or AWS</li>
            <li>Previous experience working in an agile delivery team</li>
            <li>Experience working with the Domain Driven Design approach</li>
            <li>Experience with ServiceStack and .Net Core</li>
            <li>Experience writing testable quality code, Unit Testing Frameworks (xUnit for Backend and jest/testing-library for Frontend)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
          <p>I took part in 3 different personality tests, being the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"> Myers-Briggs personality test,</a> the <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/">Big Five personality test</a> and the <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">learning styles test.</a>
          <img src="img\logistician.png" alt="Logistician Personality Type" class="center">
          <p>The Myers-Briggs returned a result of Logistician (ISTJ-T) consisting of traits:</p>
          <ul class="main-list">
            <li>Introverted: 90%</li>
            <li>Observant: 59%</li>
            <li>Thinking: 55%</li>
            <li>Judging: 51%</li>
            <li>Turbulent: 74%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>With a Sentinel role and Constant Improvement strategy.</p>
          <p>16personalities define the Logistician personality type as thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions and take pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.</p>
          <p>The Big Five personality test gave results of 4th percentile Extroversion, 9th percentile Emotional Stability, 11th percentile Agreeableness, 57th percentile Conscientiousness and 8th percentile Intellect/Imagination.</p>
          <img src="img\BigFivePersoanlity.png" alt="Big Five Personality Test">
          <p>The learning style test resulted in a greatest match with a pragmatist style of learning, meaning needing to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world.</p>
          <p><a href="Resources\LearningStyles.pdf">See results of learning styles test here.</a>
          <p>None of these results were shocking to me at all as I know myself quite well and try to play to my strengths and weaknesses on a regular basis, being heavily introverted does make interacting with others a little hard at times but I have learned and succeeded quite well in doing so. I don’t believe these traits will reflect badly in my ability to work in a team, although I may get a little grumpy with people who don’t pull their weight, though I’m sure is the same of most other people. I need to remember I’m not the only one on the team in these studies and play to my strengths instead of trying to do all the content myself.</p>
          <h2>Project Idea</h2>
          <p>Game builder for kids. Like the popular game Minecraft that many kids (and adults) love to play, building your own world and exploring different themes and levels made by others or something like Rollercoaster Tycoon, building your own rides and amusement park, the addiction to building things is unreal and my idea is to make a game directed at younger kids that is very user friendly and easy to use, revolving around building your own world.</p>
          <p>The game will consist of many pre-designed map tiles consisting of grasslands, ponds, lakes, beaches, deserts and characters, trees, obstacles, fences that the player can select and input into their very own map, designing their world from the ground up. It will be a basic game aimed mainly at mobile but could also be scalable to a much more complex version for older audiences. The game will look similar to the old Pokemon games or Stardew Valley, allowing seamless gameplay on less powerful devices that people may be playing on.</p>
          <p>Players will be able to create a game similar to a farming simulator, or completely opposite they could make a shoot’em’up, all dependent on their choices of map tiles and enemy or friendly NPC’s. The game will require some sort of currency as a reward for playing, offering unlocks and upgrades to keep a players attention and motivation for playing alive.</p>
          <p>The game will require a lot of skills I do not have currently, such as Unity, Construct2 and others for mobile development. It will also require a lot of graphic design to make the game attractive and lively. It should require no more than a basic PC to create (and play) and a mobile device for testing purposes. </p>
          <p>The purpose of this project is not to solve any real world issues or introduce any fancy new programs or algorithms into the world, it’s just a simple game that I believe I would have found really fun when I was growing up, all while introducing the young players into the world of game development and perhaps sparking an interest in IT for them too.</p>
